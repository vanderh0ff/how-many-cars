# how-many-cars
answers the question how many car lengths is a route

this is a silly program that im writing due to a silly conversation with my friend and her four year old son, the goal of this program is to be able to put in a make of a car (eg ford f150) and get the number of them you could put end to end on a route (eg from wilmington nc to san fransisco ca)
